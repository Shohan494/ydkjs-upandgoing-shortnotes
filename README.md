> For some computer languages, this translation of commands is typically done from top to bottom, line by line, every time the program is run, which is usually called interpreting the code.
For other languages, the translation is done ahead of time, called compiling the code, so when the program runs later, what's running is actually the already compiled computer instructions ready to go.

> It's typically asserted that JavaScript is interpreted, because your JavaScript source code is processed each time it's run. But that's not entirely accurate. The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.

###### Here are some of the most common operators in JavaScript:

- Assignment: = as in a = 2.
- Math: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division), as in a * 3.
- Compound Assignment: +=, -=, *=, and /= are compound operators that combine a math operation with assignment, as in a += 2 (same as a = a + 2).
- Increment/Decrement: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), as in a++ (similar to a = a + 1).
- Object Property Access: . as in console.log().
- Objects are values that hold other values at specific named locations called properties. obj.a means an object value called obj with a property of the name a. Properties can alternatively be accessed as obj["a"]. See Chapter 2.
- Equality: == (loose-equals), === (strict-equals), != (loose not-equals), !== (strict not-equals), as in a == b.
- Comparison: < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or loose-equals), >= (greater than or loose-equals), as in a <= b.
- Logical: && (and), || (or), as in a || b that selects either a or b.
